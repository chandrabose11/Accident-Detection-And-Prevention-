Project Overview
This project aims to enhance road safety in hairpin curves and hilly areas by utilizing IoT (Internet of Things) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies. The system focuses on preventing accidents and providing real-time alerts to drivers. Using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection, the system detects approaching vehicles, warns drivers about potential hazards, and sends alerts to emergency responders in case of an accident.

Features
Real-time Vehicle Detection: Detects vehicles approaching dangerous curves using the YOLO algorithm.
Driver Alerts: Notifies drivers with LED indicators, buzzers, and a 16x2 display to prevent collisions.
Accident Detection and Emergency Notification: In case of an accident, sends automatic alerts to nearby emergency responders with the vehicle's location using GSM and GPS.
IoT Integration: Uses NodeMCU (ESP8266) to handle data transmission between devices for reliable and secure communication.
Technologies Used
YOLO (You Only Look Once): Real-time object detection algorithm trained on the COCO dataset.
ESP32 Camera Module: Captures live video feed for vehicle detection.
NodeMCU (ESP8266): Microcontroller used for communication between components.
GSM & GPS Modules: Sends accident notifications and provides real-time location tracking.
Firebase: Real-time database for storing and retrieving data.
System Architecture
ESP32 Camera Module: Captures real-time video feed of the road.
YOLO Algorithm: Detects vehicles approaching a hairpin curve.
NodeMCU: Sends alerts via LED, buzzer, and 16x2 display to notify drivers of potential hazards.
GSM & GPS Modules: Sends automatic notifications to rescue teams in case of an accident.
Setup and Installation
Hardware Requirements:
ESP32 Camera Module
NodeMCU (ESP8266)
GSM Module
GPS Module
LED, Buzzer, and 16x2 Display
Software Requirements:
Python (for YOLO implementation)
OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras
Arduino IDE (for programming NodeMCU and ESP32)
Firebase account for real-time data storage
Installation Steps:
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/accident-detection-prevention.git
cd accident-detection-prevention
Set Up the YOLO Algorithm:

Install necessary libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python tensorflow keras
Configure YOLO by downloading pre-trained weights from the COCO dataset and setting up the detection model.
Upload Code to ESP32 and NodeMCU:

Use the Arduino IDE to upload the provided code to the ESP32 Camera and NodeMCU.
Install the required libraries in the Arduino IDE (e.g., ESP8266WiFi, FirebaseESP8266).
Configure GSM and GPS:

Connect the GSM and GPS modules to the NodeMCU for sending real-time location alerts.
How It Works
Detection: The ESP32 camera captures video footage in real-time, and the YOLO algorithm detects approaching vehicles within a 10-15 meter range.
Driver Alerts: When a vehicle is detected, LED lights and a buzzer are triggered to warn the driver. A 16x2 display also shows detailed information about the detected vehicle.
Accident Detection: If an accident occurs, the system sends automatic notifications via the GSM module, with GPS providing the exact location to emergency responders.
Data Storage: Detection and accident data are stored in Firebase for easy retrieval and analysis.
Future Enhancements
Integrate weather sensors to monitor real-time road conditions like fog or rain.
Add more advanced notifications such as voice alerts or mobile app notifications for drivers.
Extend the system to monitor other road hazards like landslides or rockfalls.
